# FrontEnd Mokepon Mini Game Project from Plazi:

An adaptation of the game Rock-Paper-Scissors tuned into MOKEPON. Here are the .js, .html and .css files.
The logic follows water beats fire, fire beats earth and earth beats water. There are three characters and you choose your opponent🌱🔥💧.
Have fun with this little logic game in your fav browser!

js. file is still having improvements...👩‍💻
